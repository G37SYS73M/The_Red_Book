# Processes

st running processes with the `ps` command.  The information returned includes the ID of the process (PID), the PID of its parent process, the process architecture (x64 or x86), the session ID, and the user running it.  The output is primarily ordered by PID and then by the PIDs of its children.  For instance, this output shows that registry (88), smss.exe (308), and Memory Compression (2052) are all children of System (4).

```batch
beacon> ps
[*] Process List                              
```

You will not be able to read the arch, session, or user information of processes other than your own, unless your Beacon is running in high-integrity.  This is covered in the [Privilege Escalation](https://www.zeropointsecurity.co.uk/path-player?courseid=red-team-ops\&unit=674b76f01ed1d05747055009) chapter.
