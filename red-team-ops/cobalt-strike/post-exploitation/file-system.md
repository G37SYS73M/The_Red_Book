# File System

Interacting with the local file system is one of the most basic forms of enumeration.  The `ls` command, with no arguments, will list the files and directories in the current working directory.

```
beacon> ls
```

Providing a path will list the target directory. This can be either an absolute or relative path:

```
beacon> ls C:\Users
```

The `cd` command will change the working directory of the Beacon which also accepts an absolute or relative path.

> Use the `drives` command to see if a machine has any additional drives.

Another way to interact with the file system is via the File Browser.  This can be accessed with the `file_browser` command or by right-clicking on the Beacon (in the table or graph view) and selecting **Explore > File Browser**.  The first directory it loads will be the current working directory.

Directories that are greyed out have not yet been viewed.  To drill down into a directory, double-click it in the central view, or single-click in the drive view (to the left).  The file browser sends jobs to the Beacon, so you cannot load data faster than its current check-in time.

The file browser will retain all the data whilst it's open.  If you close the tab, all the data will be forgotten and opening a new file browser tab will not retain the previous data collected.
